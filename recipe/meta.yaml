  summary: Simple finite elements in Python
  description: >-
    SfePy is a software for solving systems of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) by the finite element method in 1D, 2D and 3D. It can be viewed both as black-box PDE solver, and as a Python package which can be used for building custom applications. The word simple means that complex FEM problems can be coded
    very easily and rapidly.
